## MVC / Database Project

  This is mostly a project to practice and perfect Model-View-Controller website pattern, using ASP.NET and Entity Framework.  
  
  A note: Running this project locally will require an IIS installation on the machine you intend to run the site on. I recommend cloning to a Microsoft Visual Studio project and running that.
